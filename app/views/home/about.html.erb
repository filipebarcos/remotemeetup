            <h3>The problem</h3>

            <p>
              Talking with people in the last few days, people from France, Canada, USA, Ukraine, Brazil, Londonâ€¦They all have the same problem: they are looking for meetups, but there are no meetups of interest near them.
            </p>


            <h3>Remote Meetups</h3>

            <p>
              When you are going to a meetup, normally you want to:
              Improve your networking, meet new people
              Keep updated about technologies/what people are learning
              If you are going to a Remote Meetup, you can achieve both of these goals and, additionally, you are totally free to invite anyone you want, a core committer, for example, someone whose project you follow on Github, or someone you heard as a guest on a podcast show! The possibilities are endless!
            </p>
